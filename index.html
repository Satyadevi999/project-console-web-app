        Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. 
        It is used to develop computer programs, as well as websites, web apps, web services and mobile apps.
         Visual Studio uses Microsoft software development platforms such as Windows API, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows Store and Microsoft Silverlight. 
         It can produce both native code and managed code.

        console.log() is used as a debugging tool to help you understand what your code is doing.
        By displaying a message containing either descriptive text that tells you what is happening or the value of particular variables, you can follow along as your code executes.
        The user of your app will not see the console.log() messages.
